      <h3 id="about">About Fred's Bakery</h3>
      <article>
        Fred the Baker is tired of making real 
        donuts and is ready to retire. He needs 
        our help to keep his love of donuts alive.
        He wants you to create a game that uses button 
        clicks to create virtual donuts for the world to 
        enjoy. But all those early mornings of donut making 
        may have tired out his brain because he has some 
        trange requirements for 'Auto Clickers' and 'Donut 
        Multipliers'. Unfortunately, it's always "Time to 
        make the Donuts" and Fred is too busy to give us 
        guidance on how to implement these requirements.

      <h3 id="aboutTheGame"> The Rules</h3>
      <article id="howToPlay">
        So you want to make donuts, do ya? <br>
        <br>
        Well here is how! <br>
        <br>
        First: you must make the donuts! <br>
        You can do this by clicking on the donut! <br>
        <br>
        Second: Oh! My cramp! <br>
        Lets say you have been clicking for a while now and your hand cramps up. Ouch! <br>
        Feeding your need for donuts without actual getting   diabetes is hard work right? Well, for <br>
        the first 100 donuts you can buy an <br>
        What is says silly!  <br>
        It automatically clicks donuts! This gives a click per 1000   milliseconds.The more you buy, <br>
        the more milliseconds you gain, the more auto clicks (and less hand cramping) you will have. <br>
        Ain't that nice? <br>
        But be warned!!  <br>
        The price goes up per buy 10%, so be careful or you may find that you will become the bankrupt! <br>
        Your sweet tooth will hate you! <br>
        <br>
        But wait…what if that’s not enough?<br>
        Well that is where three comes in! <br>
        <br>
        Third: Multiple them donuts, honey! <br>
        The Donut Multiplier multiplies your donuts by 1.2. So you get even more donuts! The price does <br>
        go up 10% to but is only 10 donuts so at lest you don’t have to get a hand to afford it. <br>
        <br>
        Now what if you are the sneaky employ or student who is oh so board with their work that they must <br>
        play this came during that meeting where the boss drones on and on or that professor that is the <br>
        cousin to the “Bueller” teacher?<br>
        <br>
        Well that is tots what the reset button is for, dude! Just like totally! <br>
        <br>
        All is left to do now is play until your sweet tooth is happy! <br>
        Enjoy! <br>
